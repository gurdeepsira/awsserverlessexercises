Setup

Go to the AWS Management Console, click Services then select Cloud9 under Developer Tools.

Click Create environment.

Enter Development into Name and optionally provide a Description.

Click Next step.

You may leave Environment settings at their defaults of launching a new t2.micro EC2 instance which will be paused after 30 minutes of inactivity.

Click Next step.

Review the environment settings and click Create environment. It will take several minutes for your environment to be provisioned and prepared.

Once ready, your IDE will open to a welcome screen. Below that, you should see a terminal prompt.

You can run AWS CLI commands in here just like you would on your local computer. Verify that your user is logged in by running aws sts get-caller-identity.

aws sts get-caller-identity
You'll see output indicating your account and user information:

ec2-user:~/environment $ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "UserId": "AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice"
}
Keep your AWS Cloud9 IDE opened in a tab throughout this workshop.
